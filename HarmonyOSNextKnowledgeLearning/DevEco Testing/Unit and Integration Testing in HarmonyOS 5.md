## Unit and Integration Testing in HarmonyOS 5

Testing and debugging are essential steps to ensure the quality and stability of any application. For HarmonyOS 5 development, **unit testing** and **integration testing** are two key approaches to validate the independence and collaboration of modules. This article walks through how to conduct both types of tests effectively in HarmonyOS.

## 1. Unit Testing

### 1.1 Purpose

Unit testing verifies the smallest testable parts of an application (such as functions or methods). It allows early detection of bugs and ensures correctness. The objectives are:

- Ensure individual module functionality;
- Detect and fix logical issues early;
- Support refactoring with automated regression checks.

### 1.2 Tools

HarmonyOS supports various mainstream testing frameworks:

- **GTest (Google Test)**: C++ unit test framework with rich assertion support;
- **Mockito**: Mocking framework for Java unit testing;
- **JUnit**: Standard framework for Java-based unit tests, also applicable for HarmonyOS Java modules.

### 1.3 Example

A sample test for an addition function using GTest:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include "calculator.h"

TEST(CalculatorTest, AddFunction) {
    Calculator calc;
    EXPECT_EQ(calc.add(2, 3), 5);
    EXPECT_EQ(calc.add(-1, 1), 0);
    EXPECT_EQ(calc.add(0, 0), 0);
}

```

### 1.4 Execution

Use the following command to execute tests:

```bash
./calculator_test
```

The output shows test results. If a test fails, review the assertion messages, update the code, and rerun the tests.

## 2. Integration Testing

### 2.1 Purpose

Integration testing ensures that modules work together as expected. It checks interface calls, data transfer, and business workflows. It helps to:

- Validate inter-module communication;
- Confirm correctness of API calls;
- Ensure end-to-end process consistency.

### 2.2 Tools

Common tools for integration testing in HarmonyOS:

- **Unity**: Lightweight C testing framework, supports cross-platform;
- **Postman**: For API simulation and response verification;
- **TestRunner**: Official test runner for HarmonyOS, supports CI/CD integration.

### 2.3 Example

Testing a weather app's integration from frontend to backend:

```typescript
it('should get weather based on user location', async () => {
    const location = getUserLocationMock();
    const weather = await getWeatherFromServer(location);
    expect(weather.status).toBe(200);
    expect(weather.data).toHaveProperty('temperature');
});
```

### 2.4 Debugging Tips

Due to complexity, common debugging strategies include:

- **Logging**: Track input/output across modules;
- **Mocking**: Replace external dependencies with mocks;
- **API debugging tools**: Use Postman to validate API interactions.

## 3. Conclusion

Unit and integration testing are essential for ensuring stability and reliability in HarmonyOS 5 apps. By designing and executing tests properly, developers can catch issues early and maintain high-quality code. Combining these with CI/CD tools enables automation and boosts overall development efficiency.
