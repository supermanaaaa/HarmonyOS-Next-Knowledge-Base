# HarmonyOS 5 Cangjie Language Anti-Reverse Engineering Practice: Obfuscation Techniques and Security Hardening

This article explores in depth the **anti-reverse engineering capabilities** of Huawei's **HarmonyOS 5** system, focusing on the **Cangjie language's obfuscation and hardening techniques**. The content is based on actual development practices and aims to serve as a resource for technical exchange.



## I. Structural Obfuscation: Making Code “Unrecognizable”

In the HarmonyOS ecosystem, application security is paramount — like installing a **smart fingerprint lock** on your app logic. Structural obfuscation in Cangjie effectively disguises the architecture of your codebase.

### 1.1 Symbol Name Obfuscation in Action

Original code:

```swift
class PaymentService {
    func verifyPassword(pwd: String) -> Bool {
        // Verification logic
    }
}
```

Obfuscated decompiled output:

```swift
class a {
    func b(c: String) -> Bool {
        // Same logic but unreadable
    }
}
```

**Key Transformations**:

- `PaymentService` ➝ `a`
- `verifyPassword` ➝ `b`
- Parameter `pwd` ➝ `c`
- Debug line numbers removed or reset

### 1.2 HarmonyNext App Store Security Compliance

| Security Level | Obfuscation Requirements                       | Suitable Scenarios       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Basic          | Method name obfuscation only                   | Utility apps             |
| Financial      | Full symbol + control flow obfuscation         | Payment, banking apps    |
| Military       | Custom obfuscation + hardware-level protection | Government/military apps |

> ✅ In one banking app, structural obfuscation extended reverse engineering time from **2 hours to over 3 weeks**.

------

## II. Data Obfuscation: Invisibility for Strings and Constants

Plaintext strings in code are like passwords on a sticky note — **visible and risky**. Cangjie’s data obfuscation is like a **privacy glass**: you can see from the inside, but not from the outside.

### 2.1 String Encryption Workflow

Original code:

```swift
let apiKey = "HARMONY-12345"
```

After compilation:

```
// .rodata section:
0x1234: [Encrypted binary sequence]
```

**Decryption at runtime**:

1. Decrypts only on first access
2. Keeps plaintext **in-memory only**
3. Automatically **cleared** after process exit

### 2.2 Constant Obfuscation: Mathematical Cloaking

Original:

```swift
const FLAG = 0xDEADBEEF
```

Obfuscated:

```swift
const FLAG = (0x12345678 ^ 0xCCCCCCCC) + 0x24681357
```

> 🧠 In HarmonyNext DRM modules, this technique **increased reverse difficulty by 10x** for static analysis tools.

------

## III. Control Flow Obfuscation: Creating Logical Labyrinths

Clear control flow is a **reverser’s paradise** — it shows exactly where things go. But what if that highway became **Chongqing-style overpasses**?

### 3.1 Example: Fake and Opaque Control Flows

Original logic:

```swift
func checkLicense() -> Bool {
    return isValid
}
```

Obfuscated logic:

```swift
func checkLicense() -> Bool {
    let a = (getRuntimeValue() & 1) == 0 // Opaque predicate
    var b = false
    if a { /* Never-executed code */ }
    while (a) { /* Fake infinite loop */ }
    // Real logic fragmented and non-linear
}
```

### 3.2 Balancing Security and Performance

HarmonyNext game engine internal test results:

| Obfuscation Level | Code Size Increase | Runtime Overhead | Reverse Engineering Time |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| None              | 0%                 | 0%               | 1 hour                   |
| Intermediate      | +15%               | +5%              | 8 hours                  |
| Advanced          | +40%               | +12%             | 3 days                   |

> 🔐 **Military-grade strategy**: Use **high-intensity obfuscation on critical paths**, and **light/no obfuscation** on peripheral logic to optimize build size and runtime.

------

## 🔚 Conclusion: Obfuscation is a Strategic Tool, Not a Silver Bullet

- Symbol obfuscation **hides your API surface**
- Data obfuscation **protects secrets**
- Control flow obfuscation **hinders reverse tracing**

However:

> ⚠️ **Misusing obfuscation** can backfire — increasing code complexity, bloating size, and hurting performance.
